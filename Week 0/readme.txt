Instructions:

Your new Party Bear comes equipped with two modes: Resting and Partying. By default, your Party Bear is Resting. Left click on
the light switch sprite to set it to ON and begin the party. Left click on it again to set it to OFF and let Party Bear rest.
Clicking the green flag will reset the switch and Party Bear to their default states.

WARNING: Your Party Bear will party indefinitely while the switch is set to ON. Please do not forget to let him rest when
         partying is not required.
